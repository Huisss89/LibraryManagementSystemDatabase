# LibraryManagementSystemDatabase

# Introduction

The COVID20 library is a place that stores a variety of books and allows users to make book reservations. Furthermore, the COVID20 library has multiple branches in Alor Setar, George Town, Ipoh, Johor Bahru, Kuantan, and Rawang. Each branch allows consumers to reserve books in advance and extend their borrowing period within the time limits. Aside from that, COVID20 library will act against overdue books and demand payment from the customers. 
This project is designed and developed for a better enhancement of the COVID20 LMS database. The COVID20 LMS database is a structured data collection that maintains and organizes information related to library administration and operation. We designed a new database that can efficiently handle tasks such as cataloging on variety of books, administrative functions, book reservation status, book borrowing and renewal status, fines calculation, and record payments received in the COVID20 library.
